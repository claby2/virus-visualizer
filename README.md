# virus-visualizer

A visual model of the spread of a virus with modifiable factors such as:
- Virus Lifetime
- Amount of healthy entities
- Amount of 'still' entities 
- Amount of initially infected entities

A virus is considered to be successfully spread when an infected entity intersects with a non-infected entity. 

A graph is displayed with a consistent x-axis (time) between scenarios to monitor spread rate which tracks active cases on the y-axis.
